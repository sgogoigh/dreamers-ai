Her fingers come away\\ntinged with blood from the soaked-through gauze that\\u2019s taped\\nto her forehead.\\n\\nHer eyes adjust. Take in her surroundings --\\n\\nLow ceiling. Unpainted cinder block walls. Cement floor. No\\nwindows. A closed door.\\n\\nShe turns her head causing her to MOAN.\\n\\nAnd -- seemingly in response to her moan -- there's a\\nSHUFFLING SOUND on the other side of the door.\\n\\nMichelle goes silent.\\n\\nShe waits, listens -- but the shuffling sound doesn\\u2019t return.\\nHer eyes flit around the room as her confusion builds.\\n\\nShe peels back the blanket --\\n\\nShe's in her underwear and there\\u2019s a makeshift brace wrapped\\naround her knee.
